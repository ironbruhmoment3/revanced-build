# Revanced Build
This is ironbruhmoment's revanced build repo. I use this to build my revanced apk since doing it on computer is too tedious.

## Notes
- The current implementation without --debugging won't work on the latest Youtube nor the Youtube Music apk.
- Youtube Music non-root won't work yet. Wait until this ([commit](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches/commit/e22060b52cf09b5b6fe08d5b9ffb8f102efc6cf5)) is merged and rebuild.

## How to build
1. Run the "ReVanced Build" workflow in Actions.
